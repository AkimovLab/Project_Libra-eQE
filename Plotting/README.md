## For the output folder NAD of the MD calculation job of the MD folder, do the data analysis

## Step1ï¼š

   Using convert.py, read the NAD output folder and generate a new SD_basis folder.

```
 python convert.py 
```

(can run in terminal)

## Step2:

   Generate avg_deco.txt and other output files for different surface hopping methods using decoherence.py

```
python decoherence.py 
```

(suggest run with sbtach submit.slm)

## Step3:

   Finally, the data are visualized using ipynb code to analyze the excited state decay process, using the 2x1x1 system as an example.
